# StandApp
StandApp provides users a platform to record their audio only performances to then share with the world for feedback. Being built as a mobile-app, entirely with React JS and Redux on the frontend, and AWS S3 services on the backend, StandApp is able allow users to get rid of the concept of stage-fright by taking away the stage. Think Americas Got Talent without the stage. 

You can test it on my [live demo].
